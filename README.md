# Dog-breed-classifier
Predict dog breed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  This project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Introduction
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
